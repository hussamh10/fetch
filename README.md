Search and open any folder or file using fuzzy searches.

## Description:
Use Fetch to get to any file or folder in your computer. Fetch indexes your files and folders. Fetch uses approximate string matching (or fuzzy string search) to list the files and folders that best matches your query. You can also use parent directories to search for files and folders inside them. Fetch can also be used to search files using file types.

## Features
- Search Files and folders
- Approximate string matching
- OS wide indexing
- Periodic indexing
- Ranked results
- Search using file types

## How to Use:
### Simple directory search
When you know the approximate name of the folder.
- Open using ctrl-space from anywhere.

## Simple file search
When you know the file type and approximate name of the file.
- Open using ctrl-space from anywhere.
- Start the query with a dot `.`.

- Open containing folder using Shift Enter.
- Close/Cancel using Esc.

## Subdirectory folder search
When you know the parent directory approximate name along with the folder approximate name.
- Open using ctrl-space from anywhere.
- Type the approximate name of as many of the parent directories as you can <br> e.g. `uni sem1` for `...\University\...\Semester 1\`
- Add space after each name of directory.
- Write the approximate name of the folder <br> e.g. `uni sem1 CV` for `...\University\...\Semester 1\...\Computer Vision\`
- Navigate the list using tab and arrow keys.
- Open a folder using enter.
- Close/Cancel by Esc.
