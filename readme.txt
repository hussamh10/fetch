on cmd write f followed by the fuzzy query for the folder you want to open
example:
f bjh

this shall open the folder Bojack horseman

the search query does not support spaces or uppercase letters

A good fuzzy search query is in which the first letter of the query is the same as the actual string "bojack horseman". Also having the last letter same will also result in higher score.
